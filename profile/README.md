### Scenario:

GreenGenius is a startup that develops AI-powered energy management systems for homes and businesses. Their platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze energy consumption patterns and optimize energy usage, reducing waste and saving users money on their electricity bills.

<br>

### Problem Domain:

You team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent client company acquisition. This young, innovative startup aligns well with the mission of the client company; unfortunately, its IT systems are not yet integrated into the corporate domain and cloud infrastructure.

Your team has been assigned to prototype the process of integrating these new companies. You will need to set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing Globex infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router authenticate using Active Directory.
