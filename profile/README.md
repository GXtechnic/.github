Below you will find information about the problem domain that we are tasked with solving, and information on our members, repositories and all related resources and material.

### Problem Domain:

GXtechnic has been assigned to prototype the process of integrating new companies that align well with the misson of Globex, such as the recently acquired, young, innovative startup GreenGenius. We will need to set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing Globex infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router that authenticates using Active Directory.

### About GreenGenius:

GreenGenius is a startup that develops AI-powered energy management systems for homes and businesses. Their platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze energy consumption patterns and optimize energy usage, reducing waste and saving users money on their electricity bills.
